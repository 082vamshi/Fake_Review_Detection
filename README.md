# Fake_Review_Detection
Problem Statement

Project deals with the detection of fake reviews out of collection of reviews having various categories like political,home,sports etc.With each review having a corresponding rating,label ie Computer Generated Review(CG) and original Review generated by Human(OR) and the review text.

The Main task of this is to detect whether a given review is fraudulent or not. If it is computer generated, it is considered fake otherwise not.

Machine Learning Algorithms used:

1.Logistic Regression
2.K Nearest Neighbors
3.Support Vector Classifier
4.Decision Tree Classifier
5.Random Forests Classifier
6.Multinomial Naive Bayes

Performance Overview of ML Models:

Support Vector Machines Classifier performed the most accurate predictions regarding the fake nature of reviews having a predictive accuracy of just over 88%, closely followed by Logistic Regression which had a prediction accuracy of a little more than 86%. Random Forests Classifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm predicted to a precision level of approximately 84%. However, the Decision Tree Classifier performed fake reviews prediction upto an accuracy of just over 73%. The worst performing algorithm was the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm which could only perform the predictions upto an accuracy level of nearly 58%.
